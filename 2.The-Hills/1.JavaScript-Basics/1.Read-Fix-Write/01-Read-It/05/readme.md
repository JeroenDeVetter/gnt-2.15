* The for-loop is no longer present. 
  What was it replaced with? How does this work?
* What does the function 'parseTitle' do? 
  What parameter do we pass to this function?
* What does the function 'wrapWithTag' do? 
  Why are the parameters placed between brackets?

## My explanation

* the for loop is replased by a foreach the foreach is a type of loop that is basicly the same a a for loop but instead of hard coding it and saying how manny times he has to go throug the loop he wil automaticly detacts how manny times he has to go throug.

* the peruse of the 'parseTitle' function is to convert al the uppercase leters in the titles of the movies to lovercese leters by the build in function .toLowerCase after he has done that he clas to the fonction 'wrapWithTag' witch his function is to wrap the contant that you defined by the foreach in to the tag that you want in this case its a li how does he know this by inheritance those are in this case the parramethers you give to your funtion an by the call you give meaning to those parameters
