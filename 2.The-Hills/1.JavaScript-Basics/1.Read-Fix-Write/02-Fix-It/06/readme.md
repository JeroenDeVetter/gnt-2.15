# FIX IT
## EX 06
* We only want to display the shows with a score of 90 or more. You can only make adjustments after line 65.
* Display the score next to the title. Use the following formatting: `colony (100%)`

## how i fix it

* i made the function filter by writing in the function a if statment that says if the sore is higher or the same than 90 return that value.

* After that i made a writeShow function that wraps the content in a given tag.

* than finaly i called the filter funtion before the foreach funtion and let it run troug the shows and saying each time he goes one time throug the loop do the funtion writeShow.
